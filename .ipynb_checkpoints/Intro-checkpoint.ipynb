    "Jupyter notebooks are easily updatable web-pages that contain executable code, the results of executing the code and formatted text. They are widly used in data science and scientific computing. Some examples can be found here: http://nb.bianp.net/sort/views/ \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter seems well suited for automating some simple tasks and might useful for some test purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Jupyter had a predecessor called Ipython which only supports the Python language whereas Jupyter supports a number of different languages (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). Nevertheless, it still fully supports IPython features, so IPython documentation and examples can be used with Jupyter Notebook\n"

    "The required software is already installed on jump server 140. Here's how to open it and shut it down.\n",
    "#### Launching\n",
    "1. Go to **E:\\TEST\\Automation\\Jupyter_Notebooks**\n",
    "2. Double-click **start_jupyter_notebook.bat**\n",
    "3. A console window will open and run the notebook server. This instance should be personal to you and not affect anyone else. By default the server runs on port 8888, but if this is unavailable it will open on the first available port between 8888 and 8938.\n",
    "4. Your defult browser will open with the notebook home page *(there are supposed to be command line options which can be used to specifiy a particular browser but they don't seem to work, so change your default browser setting if you want to use a different one)*\n",
    "5. Be aware that the URL used to access the page has a token on the end which needs to be included (e.g. ` http://localhost:8888/?token=95e7b661e4afae463d6a6b97b0a9d98c074faf9178a2e7791`). **If you close the browser and want to re-access the page, the token will be required** (it's displayed in the console window and can be found from command line **`jupyter notebook list`** if in path). Alternatively, shut-down and re-start the notebook server.\n",
